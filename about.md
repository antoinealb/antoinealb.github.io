SRE @ Google ZÃ¼rich. Opinions expressed here my own, not the ones of my employer.
Previously co-founder of [WISE Robotics](http://wise-robotics.com) who studied robotics in Lausanne, Switzerland.

In my free time I write code, and sometimes it ends up on [my Github](https://github.com/antoinealb/)

I take part in the Eurobot contest with the folks from the [CVRA](http://cvra.ch).

You can contact me via [email](mailto:antoine@antoinealb.net) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/antoinealb).
