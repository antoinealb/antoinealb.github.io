title: About me
---

I am a robotics student in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Also a co-founder of [WISE Robotics](http://wise-robotics.com).
In my free time I write code, and sometimes it ends up on [my Github](https://github.com/antoinealb/)

I take part in the Eurobot contest with the folks from the [CVRA](http://cvra.ch).


You can contact me via [email](mailto:antoine@antoinealb.net) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/antoinealb).
