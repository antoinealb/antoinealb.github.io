title: Moving my site to Jekyll
---

Today I migrated my website from hand crafted HTML to a static blog using Jekyll.
But what is it ?
According to their website:

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.
> It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

What will it change for me ?
Hopefully the publishing process will be easier which means I will write more.
I know my writing skills are pretty low so far, and I plan to improve them by maintaining this site.

I wanted to write an article describing Jekyll setup, but a lot of blog already do this and it is not very complicated.
My only suggestion would be to do this in a virtual machine.
Setting up a VM using tools such as Vagrant is really painless and Jekyll has a lot of dependencies on various gems and specific versions.
It is probably totally doable to put everything in something like a virtualenv for Ruby but I did not want to think about it too much.

See you soon, anonymous readers.
